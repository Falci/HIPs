The buyer and seller must be able to interact before and during the protocol, and the final transaction is signed by both parties.
Motivation HNS users need a decentralized, platform-less way to sell the domain names they&amp;rsquo;ve acquired form on-chain auctions.</description></item><item><title>Name data standard for alternative namespace resolution</title><link>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0005/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0005/</guid><description>Abstract This HIP describes how to set the data for a Handshake name so that it can resolved via an external namespace or alternative consensus system. Resolution must be performed by an extension to a Handshake resolver which may not be included by default in full or light clients.
Motivation There may be various reasons to resolve a name on an alternative namespace other than a domain name or an name server hosted on an IP address.</description></item><item><title>Well Known directory for wallets address</title><link>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0002/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0002/</guid><description>Abstract This HIP describe how to publish a wallet address in a domain.
Motivation Wallet address are not human friendly. Sending an address normally involves &amp;ldquo;copy &amp;amp; paste&amp;rdquo; and is near to impossible to do via voice channels.
Since Handshare is all about owning domains, we could use them as alias to our wallet address.
Protocol The basics of this protocol consists in serving the address in an HTTPS request to the .</description></item><item><title>HIP Template</title><link>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0000/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0000/</guid><description>Abstract This is a section for an abstract.

Motivation A healthy secondary market for Handshake names will bring more activity to the Handshake economy. Without a solution for a decentralized secondary market, it is likely that most names will end up being managed on a custodial platform where there is liquidity for names.</description></item></channel></rss>
