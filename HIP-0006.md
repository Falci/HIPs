## Abstract

Encode and send the bid value in the same transaction as a nulldata address.

## Motivation

A backup of the seed phrase should be enough to completly recover the wallet. It should include bids not yet revealed.

## Overview

To be able to recover the bid value before its reveal, the value must to be stored on chain. Since this value should be kept secret until the reveal, it should be encode/encrypted before adding on chain.
The best place for this value to live is in the covenant array. However, changes in the covenant structure would require a hard-fork.
The next place is an extra output to a nulldata address in the bid transaction.

## Encoding

Derive an address from the nameHash using BIP-XX.
Use this new address' public key.

Formula:

```
public key ^ value = encoded;
```
